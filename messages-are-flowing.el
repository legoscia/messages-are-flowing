;;; Commentary:

;; If you're writing emails to people who might not view them on a
;; display with the same width as yours, you probably want to send the
;; messages as "flowed" (as per RFC 2646) in order to let the
;; recipient's device disregard the line breaks in your message and
;; rewrap the text for readability.  In `message-mode', you can do
;; that by turning on the `use-hard-newlines' minor mode.
;;
;; However, you probably want some of your newlines to stay put, for
;; paragraph breaks, and for content where you really do want to break
;; the lines yourself.  You can do that with `use-hard-newlines', but
;; it doesn't show you where it's going to put "hard" newlines and
;; where it's going to put "soft" ones.
;;
;; That's where `messages-are-flowing' comes in.  It marks all "hard"
;; newlines with a `⏎' symbol, so that you can have an idea about what
;; parts of your message might be reflowed when the recipient reads it.
;;
;; To activate `messages-are-flowing', add the following to your .emacs:
;;
;; (with-eval-after-load "message"
;;   (add-hook 'message-mode-hook 'messages-are-flowing-use-and-mark-hard-newlines))

;;; Code:

(defcustom messages-are-flowing-newline-marker "⏎"
  "String used to visualise hard newlines."
  :type 'string
  :group 'message-interface)

(defcustom messages-are-flowing-guess-hard-newlines nil
  "Whether to guess automatically which newlines should be marked as hard when running MESSAGES-ARE-FLOWING-USE-AND-MARK-HARD-NEWLINES. GUESS means to do so when in a buffer with newlines but with no hard newlines. NIL means always ask what to do, ALWAYS means to guess even when some hard newlines already exist in the buffer. NEVER means never to guess."
